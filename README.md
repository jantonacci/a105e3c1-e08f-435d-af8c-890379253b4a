BASH shell scripting snippets

Greetings people,

Jason here. I like BASH and Python and meat (that's what I'm made of!). I have had breakfast burritos for lunch and find them superior to lunch burritos.

This is a collection of scripts used for VMware related tasks. None of the code in this repository is a complete solution. That does not make it useless. It provides a framework for creating working code faster. Spend less time on code not directly related to the objective.

Ciao,<br>
