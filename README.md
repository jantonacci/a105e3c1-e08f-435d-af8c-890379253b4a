Swingline - Storage event compilation as Microsoft Excel Spredsheets

Greetings people,

Jason here. I like BASH and Python and meat (that's what I'm made of!). I have
had breakfast burritos for lunch and find them superior to lunch burritos.

This is a collection of scripts used for VMware related tasks.

Ciao,<br>
Jason Antonacci<br>
