Swingline - Storage event compilation as Microsoft Excel Spredsheets

Greetings people,

Jason here. I like BASH and Python and meat (that's what I'm made of!). I have
had breakfast burritos for lunch and find them superior to lunch burritos.

Swingline helps you spend less time on log search and more time on log review.
VMware vSphere storage performance issues require reviewing multiple ESXi host's
log bundles, correlating events, and educating both customer and vendors. We 
need an automated method to accelerate review, generate results suitable for
collaboration, and do quick statistical analysis. Swingline!

Ciao,<br>
