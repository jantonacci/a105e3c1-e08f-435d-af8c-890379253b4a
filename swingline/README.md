## Create Microsoft Excel Spredsheets from VMware ESXi SCSI storage I/O events ##

Greetings people,

Jason here. I like BASH and Python and meat (that's what I'm made of!). I have had breakfast burritos for lunch and find them superior to lunch burritos.

Swingline helps you spend less time on log search and more time on storage review. VMware vSphere storage performance issues require reviewing multiple ESXi host's log bundles, correlating events, and educating both customer and vendors. We need an automated method to accelerate review, generate results suitable for collaboration, and do quick statistical analysis. Swingline!

Ciao,
